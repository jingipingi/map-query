# map-query

There I was: searching for new housing and finding it incredibly difficult to understand whether each neighborhood had all the amenities I wanted.

I essentially wanted a tool where I could overlay several google maps search results at once, to view amenity density.

For example, I wanted to search for things like: "gym", "pharmacy", "park", "board game parlor", all at once.

Since it's not possible to layer google maps search results like this, I decided to make it.

That's map query!
